// Problem statement
// Ninja is shifting to a new place named NinjaGram. To take admission to the new school, the teacher gives him a sentence and asks him to check whether the sentence is a pangram.

// A word or a sentence is called a pangram if it contains all the English alphabet letters.

// Since Ninja is new to programming, he doesn’t have much experience; he asks you to solve the problem. Can you help Ninja figure out whether the sentence is a pangram?

// Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
// Constraints:
// 1<= T <= 50
// 1<= n <= 10^4


// Where ’T’ is the number of test cases, ‘n’ denotes the number of characters in the string.

// Time Limit: 1 sec
// Sample Input 1:
// 2
// 12
// toosmallword
// 35
// TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog
// Sample Output 1:
// NO
// YES
// Explanation for Sample Input 1:
// In the first test case, the given string is “toosmallword” which contains the characters [‘t’,’o’,’s’,’m’,’a’,’l’,’w’,’r’,’d’], which doesn’t contain all the 26 alphabetic characters. Hence the answer is “NO”.


// In the second test case, the given string is “TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog” which contains the characters: [‘t’,’h’,’e’,’q’,’u’,’i’,’c’,’k’,’b’,’r’,’o’,’w’,’n’,’f’,’x’,’j’,’m’,’p,’’s’,’v’,’l,’a’,’z’,’y’,’ d’,’g’], which contains all the 26 alphabetic characters. Hence the answer is “YES”.
// Sample Input 2:

// 2
// 16
// CodingNinjas
// 10
// CodeStudio
// Sample Output 2:
// NO
// NO
// Explanation for Sample Input 2:
// In the first test case, the given string is “CodingNinjas” which contains the characters [‘c’,’o’,’d’,’i’,’n’,’g’,’i’,’j’,’a’,’s’], which doesn’t contain all the 26 alphabetic characters. Hence the answer is “NO”.


// In the first test case, the given string is “CodeStudio” which contains the characters [‘c’,’o’,’d’,’e’,’s’,’t’,’u’,’i’], which doesn’t contain all the 26 alphabetic characters. Hence the answer is “NO”.
